# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Overview

The Web Application Firewall (WAF) project is a Python-based tool designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP requests. This tool aims to mitigate common web security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other attacks by inspecting incoming requests and blocking malicious traffic.

## Features

- Filters and blocks HTTP requests based on predefined rules and policies.
- Detects and prevents common web application attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- Supports custom rules and whitelisting/blacklisting of IP addresses.
- Logs and alerts administrators about suspicious or malicious activity.
- Provides real-time monitoring and reporting of web traffic.
- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for configuration and operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `flask` or `Django` (optional) for integrating with web applications
- `regex` library for rule matching and processing
- `requests` library for handling HTTP requests and responses

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Aravjnth/Web-Application-Firewall-.git
    cd web-application-firewall
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the WAF and integrate it with your web application:
    ```bash
    python waf.py --config <config-file>
    ```

2. Customize rules, policies, and logging settings in the configuration file.

### Example

Start the WAF with a specific configuration file:
```bash
python waf.py --config waf_config.json
```

Integrate the WAF with your web application to monitor and filter incoming HTTP requests.

## Options

- `--config`: Specify the path to the configuration file containing WAF rules and settings.
- Customize WAF behavior, rules, and logging configurations in the `waf_config.json` file.
